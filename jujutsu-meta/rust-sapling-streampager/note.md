ease lru dep

we have new enough rust to build hashbrown


  Try to ease it with remove "=" may not work , see comment: https://github.com/facebook/sapling/commit/06c6da67b1ad11d137130d561451d10396c20987
    since hashbrown is compilable now ;  `hashbrown 0.15.2`,  which fails to compile until Rust [1.84]
