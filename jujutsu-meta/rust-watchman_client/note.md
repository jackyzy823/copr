    Problem 1: nothing provides requested (crate(futures/compat) >= 0.3.13 with crate(futures/compat) < 0.4.0~)
     DONE
     compat support was dropped .... try to remove this feature? (and no build error, compat is used for https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/compat/index.html)
     so i think it is not a big problem?
     Interesting project for remvoe unused features : https://crates.io/crates/cargo-unused-features
