- BuildArch problem

- Provide: bundle(v8)


use rust2rpm.toml to inject `export XXX` and others 

man 5 rust2rpm.toml
see https://www.mankier.com/5/rust2rpm.toml#Options-[scripts]_table


1) about V8_FROM_SOURCE
since export V8_FROM_SOURCE is not used in building serde-v8 (its dependent) 
so we need to patch build.rs 

or??
set .cargo/config.toml => [env] .....
NOT work since cargo rpm macro will overwrite .cargo/config.toml

or patch with remove V8_FROM_SOURCE --> force all built from source

or patcg with unsafe { std::env::set_var("V8_FROM_SOURCE",1)}


2) about v8/tools/BUILD.gn is not included? 
maybe related to cargo.toml -> exclude
rust2rpm maybe calcuate not correct ??

or if we set exclude=[] , .gn will be missing

or rust2rpm.toml 


# For "library" crates, this macro causes the crate to be re-packaged with
	
# "cargo package" (with some workarounds to to make this work even if not all
	
# dependencies are present for dependency resolution):
